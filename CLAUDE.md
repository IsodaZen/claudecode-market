# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Requirements

- AI uses Japanese for communication with users
- If the purpose of the changes is unclear, AI ask the user for context before proceeding
- Use AskUserQuestion actively.

## Project Overview

**claudecode-market** is a plugin marketplace for Claude Code. The repository is currently in its initial setup phase.

## Project Purpose

This project aims to provide a marketplace platform where Claude Code users can discover, share, and install plugins/extensions for Claude Code.

## Development Status

This is a new repository with minimal structure. When developing features for this project:

- The primary language and technology stack have not yet been established
- No build, test, or deployment configurations exist yet
- Architecture and project structure decisions are still to be made

## Next Steps for Development

When adding initial structure to this repository, consider:

1. **Technology Stack**: Choose appropriate technologies for a marketplace platform (e.g., web framework, database, API design)
2. **Core Features**: Plugin listing, search/discovery, installation mechanism, user authentication
3. **Integration**: How this marketplace will integrate with Claude Code's plugin system
4. **Repository Structure**: Organize code into logical directories (frontend, backend, shared, etc.)

## Language

Based on the README, this project is primarily intended for Japanese users (README is in Japanese), but code and documentation should follow international standards.
